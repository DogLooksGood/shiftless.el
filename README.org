* Usage

Detecting your key holding, automatically convert a series of lowercase characters to a single uppercase.

When you holding a key, there's a ~delay~ before the repeating start, and a ~interval~ between each repeat.

For example, I use

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
xset r rate 180 45
#+END_SRC

So in my case, key repeat ~delay~ is 180ms, and key repeat ~interval~ is 45ms.

Now I can enable the shiftless with:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq shiftless-delay 180)
(setq shiftless-interval 45)
(shiftless-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* Limitations

Not work with kmacro, since we know nothing with time in kmacro.

You need a high keyboard repeat rate, at least higher than your finger can do.
